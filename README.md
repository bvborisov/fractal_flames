fractal_flames
==============
Fractal Flames git repository, created by Bilyan Borisov.

This is an old project from a first year competition in OO. To try it out, compile all the files in FF.src using

javac *.java

And then go to the level of the directory FF (doing cd .. twice from FF/src/) and then execute 

java FF.src.FractalFlames

From the mini GUI, select image dimension (images are squares, 2048 works okay), number of iterations (the more the better,
but for 2048x2048 10000000 works okay), 
and pick a type of fractals. The best looking ones are diamond, swirl, disk, and polar, but by all means try them all. 
Images can also be saved.
